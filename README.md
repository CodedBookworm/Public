All of my worthwhile public coding projects will be found here. The first one is a project called "Tea Cozy" which utilizes my knowledge of the flexbox layout, as well as media queries, and other HTML and CSS concepts. As my knowledge increases the intricacy of the projects will do so as well. If any of these projects can help anyone else learning on their Coding Journey feel free to use them. Happy coding! :)
